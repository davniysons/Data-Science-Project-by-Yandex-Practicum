## Project_01
  - ### Basic Python - "Big city music by Yandex.Music"
Comparison of Moscow and St. Petersburg is surrounded by myths. For example:
Moscow is a metropolis subject to the rigid rhythm of the working week;
Petersburg is a cultural capital, with its own tastes.
Based on Yandex.Music data, we will compare the behavior of users in the two capitals.
  
## Project_02
  - ### Data Processing  - "Borrower Reliability Research"
The customer is the bank's credit department. It is necessary to find out, whether family status and number of children of the client influence on the fact of loan repayment in due time. Input data from the bank - statistics on clients' solvency. The results of the research will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to the bank.

## Project_03
  - ### Exploratory data analysis - "Yandex.Apartments"
At your disposal is the data of the service Yandex. Apartments for sale in Saint-Petersburg and neighboring settlements for several years. You need to learn how to determine the market value of real estate. Your task is to set the parameters. This will build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.

## Project_04

You are an analyst of Megaline, a federal mobile operator. The clients are offered two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra". To adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which tariff brings more money.

## Project_01
  - ### Basic Python - "Big city music by Yandex.Music"
Comparison of Moscow and St. Petersburg is surrounded by myths. For example:
Moscow is a metropolis subject to the rigid rhythm of the working week;
Petersburg is a cultural capital, with its own tastes.
Based on Yandex.Music data, we will compare the behavior of users in the two capitals.
  
## Project_02
  - ### Data Processing  - "Borrower Reliability Research"
The customer is the bank's credit department. It is necessary to find out, whether family status and number of children of the client influence on the fact of loan repayment in due time. Input data from the bank - statistics on clients' solvency. The results of the research will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to the bank.
